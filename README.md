First project: To recreate Google homepage
Thiings I have learned along the way creating this: 
1. This was a bit of challenge due to time restrictions working full time.
2. Project was fun. I do have some html and css experience so this is a nice refresher for me.
3. I need to practise writing clean code. 
4. Was always used to the Git UI using putty and tortoise git.
5. Learning git using hte command line really helped with my understanding on how powerful the command line can be.
